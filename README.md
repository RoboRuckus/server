# RoboRuckus
RoboRuckus game, currently in progress.

### Installation instructions at http://www.roboruckus.com/documentation

## To do list:
* __Replace discontinued front magnetometer with new part.__
* Modify robot power supply so wheel motors don't run directly off the batteries. Potentially add this boost circuit https://www.adafruit.com/product/1903
* Modify server code to use robot "slide" move (side-to-side movement) and offload the way the robots do that (e.g. turn, move, turn back) to the robots. This alows robots that could drive sideways to work.
* Design and 3D print new chassis for the robots.
